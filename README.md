# fem-gl-toying
Toying around with WebGL to get the hang of JavaScript (importing data, promises and so on).

It simply displays a three dimensional 'F' rotating with 60 degrees per second.

Clone into a local folder and start a HTTP server in that folder (for example under Linux 
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` although that is not very fast) then direct your browser
to http://localhost:8000.

This relies on [twgl.js](https://github.com/greggman/twgl.js/) to keep the number 
of WebGL boilerplate lines low.
